  <p3>Reuben was a main character in Minecraft: Story Mode through episodes 1-4. He was Jesse's pet pig and best friend. They both lived in a treehouse, with Axel and Olivia.
    Reuben appeared to be a regular Minecraft pig with bigger eyes and eyebrows. He also had a brown mark on his body. Reuben was often seen as a happy companion, and he loved Jesse unconditionally. However, he could be seen getting upset with Jesse,
    especially if he/she ignored him or forgot about him momentarily. Reuben was Jesse's pet pig and best friend. Throughout the story, Jesse cared for Reuben, and protected and comforted him when he was upset. Although Reuben did not speak, he and Jesse
    were able to communicate, and Reuben was able to help him/her on numerous occasions. When Reuben dies, Jesse is very sad and makes sure that he is not forgotten.</p3>

  <p>"Every morning I wake up and, just for a minute, I can pretend that he's just in another room, or rooting outside looking for carrots. And then every morning I get to remember all over that he's gone."</p>
  <p2>â€”Jesse to Lukas, saying how he/she misses Reuben.</p2>
